## Introduction

The Finance Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of personal or organizational financial metrics, including expenses, income, and savings, over a multi-year period. This dashboard is designed to help users track financial performance over time and make informed financial decisions based on data-driven insights.

## Dashboard Purpose

The primary purpose of this Finance Dashboard is to:

- Visualize financial trends, such as monthly and yearly expenses, income, and savings.
- Monitor financial targets and measure progress towards achieving them.
- Offer insights into savings percentages and the distribution of expenses across various components (e.g., rent, groceries, health, etc.).
- Support users in managing finances by comparing expenses against savings and helping identify areas for improvement.

## Key Requirements

To create a dashboard like this, the following requirements must be met:

- Data Collection: Historical data on income, expenses, and savings, ideally broken down by month and year.
- Expense Categories: Detailed categorization of expenses (e.g., rent, health, leisure) to provide a granular view of spending.
- Visualization Tools: Utilization of Power BI features such as line charts, pie charts, and KPIs to display trends, breakdowns, and comparisons.
- Interactive Filters: Filters for selecting specific years and months, enabling users to view data for specific time frames.
- KPI Cards: Indicators for key metrics like total expenses, income, savings, and savings percentage to offer quick insights at a glance.

## Conclusions

The Finance Dashboard demonstrates the effectiveness of tracking financial data to identify trends and support budgeting decisions. Key findings from the dashboard include:

- Spending Patterns: Visuals reveal monthly and yearly expense trends, highlighting fluctuations and potential saving opportunities.
- Savings Rate: The savings percentage and comparisons between expenses and savings (e.g., Exp_vs_Sav metric) indicate financial health and efficiency in savings.
- Income vs. Expenses: By comparing income and expenses, the dashboard helps users understand their net savings and provides a clear picture of financial stability.


This dashboard enables users to make well-informed financial decisions, optimize spending, and better plan for future financial goals.
